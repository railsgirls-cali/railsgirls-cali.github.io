# Rails Girls Cali

## Rails Girls Guides

Our aim is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet.

Rails Girls was founded in end of 2010 in Helsinki. Originally intended as a onetime event, we never thought to see so many local chapters all around the world!

## Quick start

View the guides at http://guides.railsgirls.com or clone this repo and install & run [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

### Installing jekyll

*Use Ruby version 2.6.2*

`cd railsgirls-cali.github.com`

`bundle install`

### Pygments and Code Highlighting

The guides use the [pygments](http://pygments.org/) library to do syntax highlighting. If you don't have it installed you won't be able to see the highlight sections like the following:

```
{% highlight %}
{% endhighlight %}
```

If you aren't editing the code blocks, you can safely ignore this. If you want pygments, you can follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install) in the "Pygments" section.

### Run jekyll

`jekyll serve`
